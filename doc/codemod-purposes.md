- `react-codemod` (ignore)
  - The scripts in this repository perform changes which are helpful when migrating applications to newer versions of the React framework. To ensure that they work robustly in large codebases, most of the scripts handle multiple special cases and contain extensive checks. Handling this many special cases and checks is out of scope for our system.
