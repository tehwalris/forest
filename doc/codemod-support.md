    - `add-pass-test` (almost)
      - can't match one of multiple types (function _or_ arrow)
      - can't unwrap `co.wrap` and later combine it with other cursors
      - can't strictly check that `t` is used
        - no strict find uses (but codemod doesn't do that either)
        - lookup table for asserts is possible with regex but impractical
    - `mocha2ava`
      - `extractDescribes` (no)
        - can do the flatten sometimes, but not in the general case
          - would need "move cursors up to common ancestor cursor" command
        - can't do renaming
          - can't work with strings
          - can't collect path of ancestors to construct name from
          - can't write complex logic
      - `it2test` (maybe)
      - `this2content` (yes)
      - `insertRequires` (no)
        - import statements are not supported
        - can't check whether import statements are used an then branch on that
          - would require cursor snapshots
- `undecorate-codemod` (no)
  - general notes
    - can't work with classes or decorators
- `vue-codemods`
  - general notes
    - obviously can't work with vue files directly, but could do some equivalent task with plain js
  - codemods
    - `sort_keys` (no)
      - no sort feature
    - `uppercase_constants` (no)
      - note: generally not a very correct codemod
      - can't filter top-level statements
      - can't find all usages
        - either correctly with built in support
        - or roughly by searching for an identifier from the selection
      - can't search for more copies of the same literal
      - can't match one of multiple types (string _or_ regex _or_ number)
      - can't search up until a result is found
        - a node _within_ some surrounding node must match
    - `extract_non_instance_methods` (almost)
      - can't filter by usages in template
        - can't filter by usages in general
      - can't remove `this` from calls after extracting method
        - can't find all usages
      - shorthand function-in-property syntax is not supported
