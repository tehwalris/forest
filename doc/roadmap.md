# Roadmap

## Stabilize foundations

I've been working on Forest on and off for a couple of years. It's reached a point where it's roughly usable, but plenty of features are still buggy or missing. Features like copy-paste and transforms, which are central to Forest, take tons of effort to implement and are nearly impossible to make stable. This is because of some core design choices, which were made long ago in the early prototyping stages. That means that the most improtant work in Forest now is about stabilizing these foundations.

## Improve tree readability

Since Forest has just a single tree view (and not a syncronized text view), it's relatively easy to navigate the tree, but often hard to read lots of code. There is lots of potential for improvement - for example better alignment, summarized code snippets and useful color coding. Here's a concept that I have in mind:

## Create consistency

At the moment Forest is buggy and inconsistent, like many other tree editor prototypes. It's important to make it consistent, simple and reliable. The current quality of Forest is acceptable for a prototype, but it needs huge improvements to get into daily use a reach a wider audience.
