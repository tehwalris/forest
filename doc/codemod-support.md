      - one_item_list: can't find calls with exactly one argument
      - none_one_many: can't select second argument on all cursors (!)
      - separately_found: would have to repeat edit manually for missing query argument vs null query
    - `deprecate-createPath-createHref-query` (yes)
      - note: this codemod replaces positional arguments with an object of named arguments
      - ignore: there's some untested parsing logic which couldn't be supported

      - same as `deprecate-createPath-createHref-query`
- `coffee-to-es2015-codemod` (ignore)
  - general notes
    - this transforms coffeescript compiler output to be more like handwritten js
    - TODO potentially worth looking at later

        - same basic task as ``webpack-babel-codemod/dynamic-require-import`, but way more complex and accurate

      - complicated: too complex

  - general notes
    - no support for classes
    - likely other issues would arise (missing jump to definition?)
- `webpack-babel-codemod`
  - general notes
    - this just converts a very specific type of `require` to an `import`
  - codemods
    - `dynamic-require-import` (almost)
      - syntax: no support for imports
        - no reason why adding it wouldn't work
      - adding_after_first_import_or_as_first_statement: adding after first import or as first statement if no imports doesn't work
        - can only do one or the other
- `lodash-to-lodash-amd-codemods` (ignore)
  - general notes
    - I don't get what this does

  - general notes
    - irrelevantly simple
      - this really only removes `debugger` calls

  - general notes

  - codemods
    - `import-declarations` (almost)
      - multiple_files: can't edit multiple files
        - can't get once-per-file behavior with only one file

      - recreate_cursors: can't add both conditional named imports (`render` and `Component`)
        - would require cursor snapshots
    - `component` (almost)
      - note: finding calls with only good properties is hacky
        - search for call, search for bad properties, reduce to first cursor, go up to call
      - recreate_cursors: "calling" both sub-transforms is hacky
        - assumes that the first transform removes all `createClass` calls that it was called with
    - `component-sfc` (yes)
      - note: actually drops some allowed options (e.g. `defaultProps`)
      - note: some movements this is doing are not safe
        - `closest`, `find`, `closest` might not be a noop
    - `component-class` (maybe)
      - syntax: no support for classes
        - would probably be possible with class support
    - `props` (yes)
      - syntax: ignoring the fact that there's no JSX or class support
      - nested_copy_paste: might not work with nested functions
    - `state` (yes)
      - ignore: adding `props` parameter if missing is hacky
        - add `state` first, then check if it's the only one and add `props`
        - would be slightly better with cursor snapshots
    - `removePropTypes` (yes)
- `mocha2ava-codemod`
  - codemods
    - `add-pass-test` (almost)
      - separately_found: can't match one of multiple types (function or arrow)
      - separately_found: can't unwrap `co.wrap` and later combine it with other cursors
      - find_usages: can't strictly check that `t` is used
        - no strict find uses (but codemod doesn't do that either)
        - lookup table for asserts is possible with regex but impractical
    - `extractDescribes` (no)
      - general_flatten: can do the flatten sometimes, but not in the general case
        - would need "move cursors up to common ancestor cursor" command
      - using_js: can't do renaming
        - can't work with strings
        - can't collect path of ancestors to construct name from

    - `it2test` (maybe)
    - `this2content` (yes)
    - `insertRequires` (no)
      - syntax: import statements are not supported
      - recreate_cursors: can't check whether import statements are used an then branch on that
        - would require cursor snapshots
- `undecorate-codemod` (no)
  - general notes
    - can't work with classes or decorators
- `vue-codemods`
  - general notes
    - obviously can't work with vue files directly, but could do some equivalent task with plain js
  - codemods
    - `sort_keys` (no)
      - sort: no sort feature
    - `uppercase_constants` (no)
      - note: generally not a very correct codemod
      - top_level: can't filter top-level statements
      - find_usages: can't find all usages
        - either correctly with built in support
        - or roughly by searching for an identifier from the selection
      - dynamic_query: can't search for more copies of the same literal
      - separately_found: can't match one of multiple types (string or regex or number)
      - search_up: can't search up until a result is found
        - a node _within_ some surrounding node must match
    - `extract_non_instance_methods` (almost)
      - find_usages: can't filter by usages in template
        - can't filter by usages in general
      - find_usages: can't remove `this` from calls after extracting method
        - can't find all usages
